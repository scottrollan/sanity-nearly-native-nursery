        as low, soggy ground, or steep, dry slopes can become beautiful focal points with the right
        native plants in place. Our staff is knowledgeable and eager to discuss native plants with
        all of our customers. If we cannot think of the right native option or options for you
        instantly, we will research your situation and get back to you with a response as soon as
        possible.
